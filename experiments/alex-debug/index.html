      <h2> Problems: Still struggling with my output part, will reference Wes's website and ask Kariya for help.  </h2>
      <h2>Challenges: </h2>
      <p> It seems like it doesn't want to prompt the output to show up? I have no idea why. The console isn't showing any errors so I am super confused. </p>
