# Notes:
#  * We have 6 items + one for the larger item
#  * All items are places within larger item
#  * Each item has its own hover meta box

# In HTML:
#   Establish some boxes where things go
#     Main box for images
#     Box on left for meta-boxes for left
#     Box on right for meta-boxes for right
#   Display larger image
#   Display smaller images
#   Display meta-boxes
#   At this point, metaboxes will just be piled up
#     in their divs, and the smaller images will be
#     piled up under the main image

# In CSS:
#   Position larger image
#   Position smaller images on top of larger images
#   Position metaboxes where they belong in their
#     respective divs
#   After everything is positioned, make the metaboxes
#     hidden by default
#   Create class 'shown' that has 'visibility: visible !important;'

# jQuery
#   For each smaller image, attach a mouseover listener that will
#     add the 'shown' class to the appropriate metaboxes
