			<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<p>For this lab, we are doing the same thing from Lab 7, which to make a window appear, but add some seasoning. Now this has some flavor.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>We mostly did this in class together as group so I referred to to what we had written in out javascript at the time. I did had some difficulty with getting the input to work at first but we were able figure it out.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This is our final website! Here is a direct link to our <a href="https://valramirez.github.io/cst252/lab10/js/lab.js">javascript code</a>  Below is what we scripted. </p>
