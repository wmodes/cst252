/* Page CSS 
 * 
 * I was tired of copying my CSS file each week, so I put all the general CSS
 * stuff in one file and called it site.css and put it in my home directory. 
 * In this file, I have any specific styling for a homework assignment in this 
 * file, page.css in my homework directory.
 * 
 * You'll notice that we can include more than one css file at the top of an html
 * file:
 *
 *  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../site.css">
 *  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="page.css">
