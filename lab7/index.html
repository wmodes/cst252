            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The sorted name was easy because I already knew how to do it. Converting to an array seems a bit like a dirty trick, but okay. Shuffling the name was more of a challenge. I'd never done that before (that I remember). I definitely fooled around a good bit to get the CSS to place the name over my image. It helped to turn borders on for that elements so I could position it properly. There are still long names that break the formatting, but it's okay for now -- a balance of simple coding and interesting results.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I'm happy with the output and wanted to type in all of my friends names to see the ridiculous anagrams. Here is the program execution:</p>
