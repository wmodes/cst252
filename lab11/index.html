            <h1>Lab 11: Conditionals</h1>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>For me, I'm crafting these exercises new this year, though I have taught JavaScript for many years. Trying to create exercises and code that build on previous things we've learned <i>and</i> experiment with new things <i>and</i> aren't too challenging for beginning programmers to complete. I liked this exercise because the Sorting Hat function makes me happy.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I created a pretty straight forward conditional in my function, but realized after writing it, the repetitive structure probably means there is a more efficient way to write this. Probably using an object as key-value pairs will be simple, work really well, and be easy to maintain.</p>
