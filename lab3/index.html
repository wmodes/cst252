            <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
            <p class="big-idea">The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>It was easy creating the file structure once I got the hang of it, but I had soem difficulty creating index.html files and making them work right. I was reorganizing an exercise I'd done before, so I had to be careful to make sure everything was consistent. Also, I was trying to familiarize myself with Atom which is similar but a little different from Sublime which I have experience with. Ulitimately, I went back to Sublime for this lab. I know that if I partner with someone, I'll have to go back to Atom to have real-time collaboration while we are coding.</p>

            <p>I'm also having some difficulty with people.ucsc.edu since I haven't logged in since last year and the sftp server seems to not be allowing me to upload my art101 folder. I put in a tech support ticket with <a href="mailto:help@ucsc.edu">help@ucsc.edu</a>. Ha! It turned out I was trying to sftp to people.ucsc.edu instead of <a href="sftp://sftp.ucsc.edu">sftp.ucsc.edu</a></p>

            <p>Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure that I made:</p>
