      <h2>Class Room Unit 1</h2>
      <img src="classroom-unit-1.jpg">
      <p>This is a large lecture room that holds maybe a couple hundred people.
        Half of the seats are filled by laconic students who are all looking at their phones and laptops. The lecturer hasn't arrived yet, so maybe you are still early for class. Perhaps there is still time to get a cup of coffee at the cafe. You'll need that too, if you want to survive your Astronomy 101 lecture.</p>

        <li class="exit" data-dest='forest1'>Slip out the back door.</li>

      <h2>Foyer of Classroom Unit 1 & 2</h2>
      <p>This is the foyer of your classroom. Students are here talking in clumps. The lecturer to the previous class is here with a few students arguing over grades and asking questions. There is a fiery lecture coming from Classroom Unit 2.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="exit" data-dest='cu1'>Go back to your classroom.</li>
        <li class="exit" data-dest='cu2'>Slip into Classroom Unit 2</li>
        <li class="exit" data-dest='quarrypath'>Head down the path to the Quarry Plaza</li>
