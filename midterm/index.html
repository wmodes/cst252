    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>I wanted to create a choose-your-own-adventure where all of the data about the locations
    and the movement for the game were all contained in the data, not in the program structure. 
    If you <a target="_blank" href="index.js">look at the code</a>, you can see how little code there is. There are about 15 lines of actual code, and all of the information about the game, all of the movement, and so on, is included in a single data object.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>

    <p>I couldn't remember at first how to store data in a JavaScript when it was being triggered by elements on a webpage. Then I remembered that actually, as long as you do not reload the page, global variables keep their value. That is how I kept track of "currentRoom."</p>
