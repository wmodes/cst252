    She has a slide of a book cover by Valerie Solanas. The professor says \
    \"SCUM stands for the \'Society for Cutting Up Men\'. So you can kind of see \
    where she is coming from. [The class laughs.]\
    The book epitomizes everything you think when you hear the word \"manifesto\": outrageous, \
    incendiary, and a demand for action. It calls for women to -- and I quote -- \
    overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation \
    and eliminate the male sex. Exciting, if a bit impractical. And perhaps a good start. \
    [The audience laughs again.] \
    But seriously, she's shooting over the top to make a point. She's giving women \
    inspiration to dream much bigger than the dreams offered them in 1967 and putting \
    men on notice.\" She pauses and flips to the next slide.<br><br>\
    \"Now obviously there's enough to say about any one of these books to fill \
    an entire lecture if not an entire class, but we're giving you the super \
    abbreviated version so we can catch you up to contemporary feminism.\"",

    description: "\"Okay, this book,\" the professor gestures at a photo of a book\
    titled <i>Sexual Politics</i>, \" came out in 1970. Millett argues for the first\
    time that sex is political and that furthermore patriarchy plays a role in \
    sexual relations. This is new stuff here. She's not only pulling sex out\
    of the bedroom, but also challenging political aspects of it. Better yet, she takes \
    on classic canonical male writers such as \
    D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer.\
    Millett argues that these authors view and discuss sex in a patriarchal and \
    sexist way. Sexual Politics was largely influenced by Simone De Beauvoir's 1949 book \
    The Second Sex, although De Beauvoir's text is known for being more \
    intellectual and less exciting than Millett's text. <br><br>\
    \"She also takes on Sigmund Freud who deserves it. [Laughs.] \
    Though in fairness, later critics\
    (mostly non-feminist) have said Millett misreads Freud. \
    But then. That's what they always say.\" The class laughs harder.\
